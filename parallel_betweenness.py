"""
Example of parallel implementation of betweenness centrality using the
multiprocessing module from Python Standard Library.

The function betweenness centrality accepts a bunch of nodes and computes
the contribution of those nodes to the betweenness centrality of the whole
network. Here we divide the network in chunks of nodes and we compute their
contribution to the betweenness centrality of the whole network.
